### About

This is my toy path tracer I work on in my free time.

It is exposed as a Hydra render delegate and comes with a standalone that accepts [Universal Scene Description](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/intro.html) (USD) files. It is cross-platform\*, GPU-accelerated, and implements the [MaterialX](https://www.materialx.org/index.html), [NVIDIA MDL](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/design-visualization/technologies/material-definition-language/) and [UsdPreviewSurface](https://graphics.pixar.com/usd/release/spec_usdpreviewsurface.html) material standards.

Complex BSDFs like [OpenPBR](https://academysoftwarefoundation.github.io/OpenPBR/), Autodesk's Standard Surface, and the glTF shading model are supported using MaterialX and its MDL code generation backend.  The MDL SDK is used to generate evaluation and importance sampling functions as GLSL code, which is compiled to SPIR-V and executed with Vulkan.

\* Hardware ray tracing is required. macOS will be supported [in the future](https://github.com/pablode/gatling/tree/wip/cgpu-metal).

### Build

There are [prebuilt binaries](https://github.com/pablode/gatling/releases) which can be copied to the `<USD_INSTALL>/plugin/usd` directory.

Alternatively, for a full source build you need to

- download the <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/MDL-SDK/releases">MDL SDK</a> 2024.1+ binaries
- download or build <a href="https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/tree/v25.08">USD 24.11+</a> with MaterialX support

> Note: it is recommended to have NASM 2.13+ or YASM 1.2.0+ in your PATH to speed up image decoding.

Do a recursive clone of the repository and set up a build folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/pablode/gatling --recursive
mkdir gatling/build && cd gatling/build
```

Pass following parameters in the CMake generation phase:
```
cmake .. -Wno-dev \
         -DUSD_ROOT=<USD_INSTALL_DIR> \
         -DMDL_ROOT=<MDL_INSTALL_DIR> \
         -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<USD_INSTALL_DIR>/plugin/usd
         -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

Build the relevant targets and install the Hydra delegate to the USD plugin folder:
```
cmake --build . --target hdGatling --config Release
cmake --install . --component hdGatling
```

### Usage

Gatling can be used by every application which supports Hydra, either natively or through a plugin.

</p>

A headless standalone is provided that accepts a USD file (.usd, .usda, .usdc, .usdz) as input. It exposes the Hydra render settings as command line arguments:

```
./bin/gatling <scene.usd> render.png \
    --image-width 1200 \
    --image-height 1200 \
    --spp 1024 \
    --max-bounces 8
```

> Note: high sample counts may require adjusting the system watchdog settings.

### Issues

Certain USD prim types (curves, cylinder lights), APIs (UsdLuxShapingAPI, UsdLuxShadowAPI) and features (subdivision, UDIM, volumes, displacement) are not yet supported.
